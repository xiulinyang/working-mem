❗❗I only revised the code for DynamicLimit-Exp and NoLimit experiments. If you want to run the other two experiments, please run the code with caution. ❗❗

# Installation
This repository uses a customized version of [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (with custom modules like `modeling_gpt2_alibi_exponential.py`).  
Please follow these steps to install the environment properly.

## 0. Prerequirments
- python==3.10.12
- uv==0.6.3
- torch==1.12.1+cu113


## 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiulinyang/working-mem.git
cd working-mem
```
## 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync uv.lock
```

## 3. Install the customized transformers in editable mode
```bash
uv pip install -e ./transformers
```

# Run
```bash
python src/DynamicLimit-Exp.py \
  --train_file path/to/train.txt \
  --tokenizer_file path/to/tokenizer.json \
  --output_dir output/
```
For example:
```bash
python src/DynamicLimit-Exp.py \
  --train_file data/sentences_with_age-ordered.txt \
  --tokenizer_file childs_tokenizer/tokenizer.json \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 512 \
  --output_dir output/
```

    abstract = "Large language models possess general linguistic abilities but acquire language less efficiently than humans. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition."
